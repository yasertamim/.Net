NOTE!
this project is not an individual project, but it is a group work where we were five students working on it


The product eventually became a functional blog where users could post their own posts as well as rate and comment on existing posts
Functionality was posted for the sale of our own products as well as a contact form where users could submit inquiries and we could 
receive it at our own e-mail address.

This would make it easy for users to get in touch with us if there should be anything. 
For viewing the blog posts, we have a search function and paging.
We have chosen a simple design on our site. 
This has not been so much in focus in this subject, but we have made an attempt to make it look good. 
We have put effort into creating a home page that looks inviting and clear.
 In the other views, we have tried to keep it simple and straightforward,
 but at the same time make some changes from the standard look.
